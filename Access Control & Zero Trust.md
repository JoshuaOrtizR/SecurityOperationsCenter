## Authentication, and Authorization, Accounting (AAA):

## Access Control:
- **Definition:**  This is the process of determining who can access specific resources and what actions they can perform. It involves defining rules and policies to regulate access.
- **Application:** A company might restrict access to sensitive data to only employees in the risght department.

## Authentication:
- **Definition:**  This is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It ensures that the person claiming to be a user is actually who they say they are.
- **Application:**  Logging into a website using a username and password or biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition).

## Authorization:
- **Definition:**  This is the process of determining what a verified user is permitted to do. It assigns specific privileges and permissions to authenticated users.
- **Application:** A system administrator might have permission to create and delete user accounts, while a regular user can only access their own account.

## Accounting:
- **Definition:**  This is a process of tracking and analyzing system activities. It involves logging user actions, system events, and security incidents.
- **Application:** Logging failed login attempts, successful file transfers, or security alerts.

## Principle of Least Privilege:
 - This principle states that users should be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions. This helps to minimize the potential damage that can be caused by malicious actors or accidental mistakes.
##
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): The owner of a resource determines who can access it and what permissions they have.
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): A central authority defines access rules based on security labels assigned to users and resources.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access is granted based on a user's role within an organization.

##
**Zero Trust (ZT)**

- This is a security model that assumes that no one or nothing can be trusted, regardless of network location. It requires continuous verification of every user and device before granting access to resources.
  - Network Access Control (NAC): Ensures that only authorized devices can connect to the network.
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM): Manages user identities and access privileges.
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires multiple forms of authentication to verify user identity.
  - Single Sign-On (SSO): Allows users to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
  - Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)

**ZTNA extends the Zero Trust model to network access.**
- It provides secure access to applications and resources, regardless of user location or device. ZTNA focuses on:
   - Security: Protecting sensitive data and applications from unauthorized access.
   - Efficiency: Simplifying access management and improving user experience.

 **Zero-trust access (ZTA) is made up of:** Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Network Access Control (NAC)
