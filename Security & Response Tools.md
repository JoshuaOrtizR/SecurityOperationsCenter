## CyberSecurity & Response ToolsðŸ”Ž

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. Some IDSâ€™s are capable of responding to detected intrusion upon discovery. These are classified as intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

There is a variaty of IDS, ranging from antivirus software to monitor systems that follow the traffic of an entire network. The most common classifications are:

- **Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS):** A system that analyzes incoming network traffic.
- **Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS):** A system that monitors important operating system files.

## SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- **Definition:**  A SIEM solution collects, aggregates, analyzes, and correlates log data from various sources, such as network devices, servers, and applications.
- **Functionality:** To identify security threats and compliance violations by detecting anomalies and patterns in the log data.
- **Softwares:** Splunk, IBM QRadar, LogRhythm

## EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- **Definition:** EDR focuses on endpoint security by monitoring and analyzing system activity on individual devices (e.g., workstations, servers).
- **Functionality:** To detect and respond to threats like malware, ransomware, and zero-day attacks.
- **Softwares:** CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender ATP, Carbon Black

## MDR (Managed Detection and Response)
- **Definition:** MDR is a service that leverages technology and human expertise to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats.
- **Functionality:** To offload the burden of security operations to a managed security service provider (MSSP).
- **Softwares:** Darktrace, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR

## NDR (Network Detection and Response)
- **Definition:** NDR focuses on network traffic analysis to identify and respond to threats like lateral movement and data exfiltration.
- **Functionality:** To detect and mitigate network-based attacks, such as DDoS and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- **Softwares:** Darktrace, ExtraHop

## SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
- **Definition:** SOAR automates repetitive tasks and integrates various security tools to streamline incident response.
- **Functionality:** To accelerate incident response times and improve overall security efficiency.
- **Softwares:** BM Security SOAR, ServiceNow Security Operations

 ## 
 

- **SIEM** collects and analyzes log data from various sources.
- **EDR** detects threats on endpoints and sends alerts to SIEM.
- **XDR** correlates data from multiple sources, including EDR and SIEM, to identify broader threats.
- **SOAR** automates incident response actions based on alerts from SIEM, EDR, and XDR.
- **MDR** provides 24/7 monitoring and response services, leveraging technology and human expertise.
- **NDR** monitors network traffic to identify and mitigate network-based threats.
