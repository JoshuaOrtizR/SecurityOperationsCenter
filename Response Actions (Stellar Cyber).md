**Response Actions**

Stellar Cyber empowers analysts to take swift action on users or assets upon event detection.

**API Connections** to security platforms facilitate **automated or analyst-initiated responses** to threats.

**Native Response Actions** allow users to respond directly through a connector.

**Alert-Level Response Actions:**
* Block IP
* Disable account
* Quarantine threat
* Initiate scan
* Add alert filter
* Trigger email
* Run script
* Shut down host

**Case-Level Response Actions:**
* Block IP
* Disable user
* Run script
* Contain host
* Disconnect host
* Kill threat
* Quarantine threat
* Remediate threat

**Email Actions:**
- None
- Delete
- Quarantine (Quarantined emails can be searched for potential threats.)

**Stellar Cyber Case Investigation Tools**

Stellar Cyber offers a comprehensive suite of tools to aid in efficient and effective security incident investigations. These tools help security analysts answer the fundamental questions of "who, what, when, where, and why" regarding a security incident. 


1. **Case View:**
   - Provides a centralized view of all related alerts and events.
   - Offers a chronological timeline of the attack, including initial access, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and impact.
   - Displays the severity and status of the case.
   - Allows analysts to drill down into specific alerts for detailed analysis.

2. **Alert Details:**
   - Provides in-depth information about each alert, including:
     - Source and destination IP addresses
     - Timestamps
     - Alert type
     - Associated threat intelligence
     - MITRE ATT&CK techniques

3. **Kill Chain Analysis:**
   - Visualizes the attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
   - Helps analysts understand the progression of the attack and identify potential mitigation strategies.

4. **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):**
   - Identifies anomalous user behavior, such as unusual login times, excessive data transfers, or unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
   - Helps detect insider threats and privilege abuse.

5. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Analyzes network traffic to identify malicious activity, such as port scanning, reconnaissance, and data exfiltration.
   - Provides visibility into network flows and helps identify compromised systems.

6. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
   - Monitors endpoint activity to detect and respond to threats, such as malware infections, ransomware attacks, and fileless attacks.
   - Provides forensic capabilities to investigate incidents and identify the root cause.

7. **Threat Intelligence Integration:**
   - Integrates with threat intelligence feeds to provide context and enrich alerts.
   - Helps analysts stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities.

**Case Response and Remediation:**

- **Action Plans:** Create and execute automated response actions, such as blocking IP addresses, disabling user accounts, or quarantining infected systems.
- **Containment:** Isolate compromised systems to prevent further damage.
- **Eradication:** Remove malware and other malicious artifacts from affected systems.
- **Recovery:** Restore systems to their pre-incident state.
- **Incident Reporting:** Generate detailed incident reports for compliance and forensic purposes.
