As a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, the primary goal is to protect organization's IT infrastructure and sensitive data. Such as monitoring networks, systems, and applications for threats, investigating security incidents, and responding to breaches.

**User Behavior Analytics (UBA):**
* **What it is:** UBA involves analyzing user behavior patterns to identify anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.
* **Why it's important:** By understanding normal user behavior, you can quickly spot deviations that could signal a security threat.
* **How it works:** UBA tools collect and analyze data on user activities, such as login times, access patterns, and resource usage. 

**MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
* **What it is:** A globally-recognized framework for classifying and categorizing adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
* **Why it's important:** It helps security teams understand how attackers operate and develop effective defense strategies.
* **How it's used:** You can use MITRE ATT&CK to map observed behaviors to known TTPs, prioritize threats, and tailor your security controls.

**Threat Modeling:**
* **What it is:** A systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing potential threats to a system or application.
* **Why it's important:** It helps you proactively identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before they can be exploited.
* **How it works:** Threat modeling involves breaking down a system into components, identifying potential threats to each component, and assessing the likelihood and impact of those threats.

**Risk Matrix:**
* **What it is:** A tool used to assess the risk associated with various threats and vulnerabilities.
* **Why it's important:** It helps you prioritize security efforts and allocate resources effectively.
* **How it works:** A risk matrix typically consists of a grid with axes representing threat likelihood and impact.

* **Credential Dumping:** The act of stealing user credentials, often through phishing attacks or malware.
* **Port Scanning:** The process of scanning a network or system for open ports, which can be used to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Audit Log Tampering:** The unauthorized modification of system logs to conceal malicious activity.
* **Shadow Copy Deletion:** The removal of shadow copies, which can be used to recover data and investigate incidents.
* **Lateral Movement:** The technique used by attackers to move laterally within a network to access additional systems and data.
* **Anomalous Login Activity:** Unusual login attempts, such as logins from unexpected locations or times.
* **Suspicious Scripts Running:** The execution of malicious scripts that can compromise systems and data.
* **Account Manipulation:** Unauthorized changes to user accounts, such as password resets or privilege escalation.
* **Anomalous Services and Executables:** The presence of unexpected services or executables that may indicate a compromise.
* **Privileged Users:** Users with elevated privileges, such as domain administrators and system administrators.
* **Monitoring and Investigation:** The continuous monitoring of systems and networks to identify and investigate security incidents.

**Standards and Frameworks:**

* **PCI DSS:** Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
* **CIS Benchmarks:** Center for Internet Security Benchmarks
* **HIPAA:** Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

**Applications:**

* **Case Activity:** The process of investigating and responding to security incidents.
* **Tagging and Categorization:** Organizing and classifying security events and incidents for efficient analysis.
* **Policy Enforcement:** Implementing and enforcing security policies to protect systems and data.
* **Incident Response:** Responding to security incidents in a timely and effective manner.
* **Risk Assessment:** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks.
* **Asset Importance:** Determining the criticality of assets to the organization.
